## Matplotlib Animation

This is a hands-on tutorial of making animations using `Matplotlib` and `Celluloid`. The target animation we will create displays various projectile motion trajectories and updates the associated histogram of the projectile shotting range. A companion blog can be found here:

# Background
The animation in this tutorial is intended to show the audience the uncertainty of the projectile shooting range under various combinations of initial projectile velocity and shooting angle. This type of visualization is also known as the **Hypothetical Outcome Plots**, which is a powerful technique that is especially good at delivering intuitive and effective *uncertainty visualization*. To learn more about hypothetical outcome plots, take a look at this article:
